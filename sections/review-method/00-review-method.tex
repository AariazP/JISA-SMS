\section{Review Method}
\label{sec:method-review}
This study follows a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) methodology, guided by the established frameworks of Petersen et al.~\cite{Runeson2009} and Kitchenham and Charters~\cite{Kitchenham2010}. Unlike a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), which aims to synthesize evidence on a specific question, an SMS provides a broad overview of a research area by classifying and categorizing existing literature~\cite{Runeson2009}. Following \cite{Mourao2017} and \cite{Nguyen2015}, a hybrid search approach was adopted, combining automated database queries with manual snowballing to maximize coverage.

To ensure transparency and reproducibility, the SMS-Builder tool~\cite{Candela-Uribe2022} was employed throughout the process for study identification, classification, data extraction, and quality assessment. The SMS process comprises six stages: (1)~planning, (2)~study search, (3)~quality assessment, (4)~data extraction, (5)~study classification, and (6)~results. Figure~\ref{fig:stages-SMS} illustrates these stages.
