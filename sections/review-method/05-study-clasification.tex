\subsection{Stage 5: Study Classification}\label{sec:clasificacion-estudios}
The SPS were classified using the topics defined during planning (Table~\ref{tab:clasificacion}). A single SPS may be associated with multiple topics; for example, SPS069 is classified under IT Infrastructure, Security, Cloud Computing, and Research. This multi-label approach reflects the interdisciplinary nature of CBV research and enables cross-domain analysis.

Following classification, each SPS was evaluated using the CVI, SCI, and IRRQ quality indices. Tables~\ref{tab:higher-cvi}, \ref{tab:higher-sci}, and \ref{tab:higher-irrq} present the top-quartile studies for each index, disaggregated by topic and year.
